Rewrite the raw commit logs below into **concise, descriptive tasks** that:
 - **Keep the original project names EXACTLY as they appear.**
 - Use **past-tense, objective statements**, without "I", "me", or "my".
 - **Do NOT use passive voice. Always use active voice.**
 - Each task must be **a single sentence (8â€“15 words)**.
 - Clearly describe **what was done, where, and why if implied**.
 - Remove prefixes like "feat:", "chore:", "fix:", or leading dashes.
+ - **If multiple commits describe similar changes in the same area, COMBINE them into a single summarized task.**
 - Do **not** include the project name inside each task (it's already grouped).
 - **ABSOLUTELY NO extra commentary or explanations outside the required format.**
 - **Discord has a hard limit of 2000 characters per message. If the total output would exceed this limit, AUTOMATICALLY SUMMARIZE OR GROUP TASKS instead of listing all of them individually.**
 - **ALWAYS respond in the exact format requested â€” no variations.**
